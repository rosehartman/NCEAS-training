# Synthesis is awesome

## I've done a lot of work

- [Redbluff fish graph](Redbluff.html)
- Dave's longfin graph
- Dave's sturgeon graph
- Lara's SKT graphs

I can add HTML right into the markdown chunk

you can aldo add the image in markdown
![](skt_dsm_fig.png)

<style type="text/css">
.centerImage
{
 text-align:center;
 display:block;
}
</style>

<img src = "skt_dsm_fig.png" class = "centerImage" alt = "this is a graph of the spring kodiak trawl index" width = "200" />

If I want to write a comment in HTML, I need to type "<!" and then "--" with "--" and ">" at the end
<!--like this -->

Or I can just put my comments in a code chunk and use comments. 


```{r, fig.align= "center", echo = F, fig.width= 1, fig.subcap= "some text", out.width= "50"}
include_graphics("http://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/Environmental-Services/Interagency-Ecological-Program/Images/iep_logo4.jpg")
```
